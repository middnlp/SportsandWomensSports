The silver medal was won by the Dutch team of Joris Pijs, Roel Braas, Meindert Klem, Tycho Mijndert, Mechiel Versluis, and Diederik Simon.
The bronze medal was won by the British team of Peter Chambers, Richard Egington, James Clarke, James Foad, Matthew Wells, and Constantine Louloudis.
However, I should note that the original Italian team that won the gold medal was disqualified due to a positive doping test by one of the rowers, and the medal was subsequently reallocated to the Lithuanian team of Mindaugas Griškonis, Saulius Ritter, Einar Virkaitis, Rolandas Beneta, Domantas Steponavičius, and Egidijus Balčiūnas.

# text = Who won the medals in the Athletics 4 x 100 metres Relay event at the 2016 olympic games?The medals in the Athletics 4 x 100 metres Relay event at the 2016 Olympic Games were awarded as follows:
* Gold Medal: Jamaica (Asafa Powell, Rasheed Dwyer, Jevaughn Minzie, Usain Bolt, and Nickel Ashmeade)
* Silver Medal: Great Britain (Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, Adam Gemili, James Ellington, Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake, and Danny Talbot)
* Bronze Medal: Japan (Ryuichiro Sakai, Shota Iizuka, Yoshihide Kiryu, and Asuka Cambridge)
However, it's worth noting that Usain Bolt was not in the starting lineup for Jamaica's 4 x 100m relay team at the 2016 Olympics. The team that actually won the gold medal was the one I listed, but Usain Bolt was not a member of it.
