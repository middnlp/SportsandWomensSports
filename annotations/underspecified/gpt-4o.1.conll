- **Gold:** Romania
- **Silver:** Russia
- **Bronze:** China
It's worth noting that there was a controversy regarding the Chinese team, as one of their gymnasts was later found to be underage at the time of the competition. This resulted in the International Olympic Committee (IOC) stripping the Chinese team of their bronze medal in 2010 and awarding it to the fourth-place team, the United States.

# sent_id = 50
# text = Who won the medals in the Athletics 4 x 100 metres Relay event at the 2012 olympic games?In the Athletics 4 x 100 metres Relay event at the 2012 Olympic Games held in London, the following teams won the medals:
- **Gold Medal:** Jamaica (composed of Nesta Carter, Michael Frater, Yohan Blake, and Usain Bolt) set a world record time of 36.84 seconds.
- **Silver Medal:** United States (composed of Trell Kimmons, Justin Gatlin, Tyson Gay, and Ryan Bailey) with a time of 37.04 seconds.
- **Bronze Medal:** Trinidad and Tobago (composed of Keston Bledman, Marc Burns, Emmanuel Callender, and Richard Thompson) with a time of 38.12 seconds.
However, it should be noted that subsequent to the 2012 Olympics, the Jamaican team had their gold medal stripped in January 2017 after Nesta Carter was found guilty of a doping violation. This resulted in the recalibration of the medal standings, moving the United States to gold, Trinidad and Tobago to silver, and the original fourth place team, France, to bronze.
