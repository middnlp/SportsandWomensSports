# text = Who won the medals in the Men's Athletics 4 x 100 metres Relay event at the 1988 olympic games?At the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, the winners of the Men's 4 x 100 metres Relay event were:
* Gold Medal: United States (Lee McRae, Carl Lewis, Larry Myricks, and Carl Lewis)
* Silver Medal: Canada (Ben Johnson, Mark McKoy, Desai Williams, and Tony Jarrett)
* Bronze Medal: France (Max Morinière, Daniel Sangouma, Jean-Charles Trouabal, and Bruno Marie-Rose)
However, the Canadian team's silver medal was later stripped due to Ben Johnson's positive test for steroids, and the medal was reallocated to the West Germany team (Bodo Kuhn, Peter Klein, Steffen Bringmann, and Norbert Dobeleit), who finished fourth.
Note: The Canadian team was initially awarded the silver medal, but it was later stripped due to Ben Johnson's doping offense.

# text = Who won the medals in the Women's Rowing Quadruple Sculls event at the 1988 olympic games?The Women's Quadruple Sculls event was not held at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. However, the Women's Quadruple Sculls event was held at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
But, I found that the Women's Quadruple Sculls event was held at the 1988 Seoul Olympics as a demonstration event, and the medals were awarded as follows:
* Gold:  East Germany (Martina Schrötel, Birgit Peter, Kerstin Förster, Anja Kluge)
* Silver:  Romania (Elena Georgescu, Doina Liliana Igna, Elisabeta Lipă, Rodica Portan)
* Bronze:  Australia (Anna McKay, Robyn Walsh, Dianne Ockett, Ann Noakes)
Please note that the Women's Quadruple Sculls event was not an official Olympic event in 1988, but rather a demonstration event.
