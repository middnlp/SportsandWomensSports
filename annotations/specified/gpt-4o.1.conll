# text = Who won the medals in the Men's Athletics 4 x 400 metres Relay event at the 2000 olympic games?In the Men's 4 x 400 metres Relay at the 2000 Olympic Games held in Sydney, the medal winners were:
- **Gold:** United States (Team members: Alvin Harrison, Antonio Pettigrew, Calvin Harrison, and Michael Johnson)
- **Silver:** Nigeria (Team members: Clement Chukwu, Jude Monye, Sunday Bada, and Enefiok Udo-Obong)
- **Bronze:** Jamaica (Team members: Michael McDonald, Greg Haughton, Danny McFarlane, and Chris Williams)
However, it's worth noting that the United States was later stripped of their gold medals due to Antonio Pettigrew's admission of using performance-enhancing drugs. As a result, Nigeria was eventually awarded the gold medals, Jamaica was moved up to silver, and the Bahamas received the bronze medals.
