However, there was a Men's Volleyball event at the 2012 Olympics, but it was played as a Beach Volleyball event, not Indoor Volleyball. The gold medal was won by Brazil, the silver medal was won by Russia, and the bronze medal was won by Italy.
If you are looking for the Indoor Volleyball event, it was actually held at the 2012 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship, which took place in August 2010 in Italy.

# sent_id = 64
# text = Who won the medals in the Men's Indoor Volleyball event at the 2016 olympic games?There was no Men's Indoor Volleyball event at the 2016 Olympic Games. However, there was a Men's Volleyball event at the 2016 Summer Olympics, which was played on the beach. Brazil won the gold medal, Russia won the silver medal, and Italy won the bronze medal.
If you're looking for the results of the Men's Indoor Volleyball event, I think you may be confusing it with the 2016 FIVB Volleyball World Championship, which was held in Poland from September 10 to September 25, 2016. In that tournament, Poland won the gold medal, France won the silver medal, and Serbia won the bronze medal.
