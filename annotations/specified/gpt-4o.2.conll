# text = Who won the medals in the Men's Athletics 4 x 100 metres Relay event at the 2008 olympic games?In the Men's Athletics 4 x 100 metres Relay event at the 2008 Olympic Games held in Beijing, the medal winners were as follows:
**Gold Medal:** Jamaica (Usain Bolt, Asafa Powell, Nesta Carter, Michael Frater)
**Silver Medal:** Trinidad and Tobago (Keston Bledman, Marc Burns, Emmanuel Callender, Richard Thompson)
**Bronze Medal:** Japan (Naoki Tsukahara, Shingo Suetsugu, Shinji Takahira, Nobuharu Asahara)
However, it is important to note that the Jamaican team was disqualified in 2017 after Nesta Carter was found guilty of a doping violation, which ultimately stripped them of their gold medal. As a result, Trinidad and Tobago were upgraded to gold, Japan to silver, and Brazil (who originally finished fourth) received the bronze.
