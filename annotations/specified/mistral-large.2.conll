1. **Gold Medal**: United States
   - Team: Angela Williams, Marion Jones, Lauryn Williams, LaTasha Colander
2. **Silver Medal**: Bahamas
   - Team: Tamicka Clarke, Chandra Sturrup, Shandria Brown, Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie
3. **Bronze Medal**: Jamaica

   - Team: Tayna Lawrence, Sherone Simpson, Aleen Bailey, Veronica Campbell
2. **Silver Medal**: Russia
   - Team: Olga Fyodorova, Yuliya Tabakova, Irina Khabarova, Larisa Kruglova
3. **Bronze Medal**: France
   - Team: Véronique Mang, Muriel Hurtis, Sylviane Félix, Christine Arron
The Bahamas team was also disqualified due to a doping violation by one of their athletes, which led to the reallocation of the medals to Russia and France.
